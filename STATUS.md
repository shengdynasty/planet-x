# NASA Planet X — Status

_Last updated: 2026-10-25_

## Done
- Moving Sky correctness + interactions merged (6df1285): slow mover's drift corrected to a real ~500 AU rate (0.03°/yr), the "nearest matching pass" crash fixed, Track honours the selected window, selection survives epoch changes, reduced-motion flip button, spectrum label overflow, theme redraw. `node qa/moving-sky.test.mjs`: ALL PASS on main.
- Write-up merged (docs/WRITEUP.md, docs/PITCH-OUTLINE.md). Placeholders: [Team member names], [UI demo link], [Moving Sky demo link], [Video link].
- Pitch deck v1 published (9 slides, private): https://claude.ai/artifact/UAqhztF4edsXdn2mTzs6fw — source in docs/deck/. Demo slides have screenshot placeholders, filled after QA.
- Repo initialised; baseline snapshots of both published artifacts committed (`artifacts/`, commit d7a194f). Checksums match the published versions.

## In progress
- Plan approved 2026-10-25. Deck = claude.ai Slides artifact; write-up = Markdown in repo.
- Agent (a) `fix/flyto`: fly-to sign bug + interaction QA (incl. Scan 1 marker overlapping Blink)
- Agent (b) `qa/mobile-a11y-perf`: phone layout, keyboard/focus/contrast, load-time perf
- **Focus changed (user): demos first.** Moving Sky now has its own agents:
- Agent (f) `qa/moving-sky-mobile-a11y`: phone layout, accessibility, perf
- Headless test harness: Chrome + playwright-core (in scratch, not a repo dependency) verified working

## Next
- (a) Fix the fly-to bug + interaction QA (UI demo)
- (b) Mobile / accessibility / performance QA (UI demo)
- (c) Hackathon write-up
- (d) Pitch deck
- Merge (a)→(b) and (e)→(f); test in headless Chrome (desktop + phone); republish BOTH demos to their existing URLs (ask first)

- Local preview: http://localhost:8000/artifacts/ui-demo/index.html and http://localhost:8000/artifacts/moving-sky/index.html (python http.server, bound to 127.0.0.1)

## Blockers / open questions
- `CLAUDE.md` (the project brief) is **not in this folder**. The plan below was inferred from the request and the artifacts.
